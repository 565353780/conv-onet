class DoubleConv(nn.Sequential):
    """
    A module consisting of two consecutive convolution layers (e.g. BatchNorm3d+ReLU+Conv3d).
    We use (Conv3d+ReLU+GroupNorm3d) by default.
    This can be changed however by providing the 'order' argument, e.g. in order
    to change to Conv3d+BatchNorm3d+ELU use order='cbe'.
    Use padded convolutions to make sure that the output (H_out, W_out) is the same
    as (H_in, W_in), so that you don't have to crop in the decoder path.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): number of input channels
        out_channels (int): number of output channels
        encoder (bool): if True we're in the encoder path, otherwise we're in the decoder
        kernel_size (int): size of the convolving kernel
        order (string): determines the order of layers, e.g.
            'cr' -> conv + ReLU
            'crg' -> conv + ReLU + groupnorm
            'cl' -> conv + LeakyReLU
            'ce' -> conv + ELU
        num_groups (int): number of groups for the GroupNorm
